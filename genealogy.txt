This is by no means complete, or even necessarily correct. It could do with some verification.

J. W. Hinchley (http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=154225)
History of Imperial College of London, 1907-2007, page 102: "John William Hinchley (1871-1931) was educated at Lincoln Grammar School, leaving to become an apprentice engineer at the Reliance Iron Works. He came to the Science Schools on a National Scholarship in 1893, was an excellent student and very active in union affairs. Later Hinchley headed the Siamese Metallurgical Services (part of the new Siamese Mint) in Bangkok. On returning to England he worked as a consultant and part-time lecturer at the Battersea Polytechnic before being appointed at Imperial. He was a founder of the Institute of Chemical Engineering in 1922. Hinchley left his excellent library to the department which was much enlarged after the Second World War by donations from A. C. G. Egerton. It was named the Egerton-Hinchley Library in 1960. See also, Edith Hinchley, _John William Hinchley: chemical engineer_ (privately printed by Lamley and Co., 1935). The author was Hinchley's widow. She claims that Hinchley did very well at his grammar school but that his family was very poor and could not afford his matriculation examination fees. They saved for the fee three times but when the money had to be surrendered for a third time, Hinchley gave up any idea of going to university and became an apprentice. He won the National Scholarship while on a vacation course in London. (From 1866-91 the matriculation fee at the University of london was [2 pounds]. While this is about [170 pounds] in today's terms, the real difference between then and now is that late Victorian society was very much poorer overall, and poor families had almost no discretionary income.)
