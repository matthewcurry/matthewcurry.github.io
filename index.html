<p> Matthew L. Curry, Ph.D., is a Senior Member of Technical Staff in the Scalable System Software department at Sandia National Laboratories. He first gained notoriety for creating one of the first systems-level applications for GPU computing, Gibraltar: A software RAID system that offloads parity computation. He has since worked on parallel file system design via Sirocco, a peer-to-peer-inspired parallel object storage system.  He also works on storage system characterization and reliability modeling. </p>

<h2> Interests </h2>
<p> This is list of technologies I have done meaningful work with in the past, in no meaningful order. I'm always interested in talking about these things, even if only maybe slightly related.
<ul>
<li> GPU computing, both with OpenGL and CUDA </li>
<li> Erasure coding, particularly RAID&nbsp;6 schemes, k+m schemes, Reed-Solomon coding </li>
<li> RAID system design, including hardware, software, and distributed </li>
<li> Distributed object stores, including RADOS </li>
<li> Distributed and parallel file systems, including Ceph and Lustre </li>
<li> Distributed storage system design </li>
<li> Application I/O patterns and optimization </li>
<li> Behavioral modeling of disks and disk systems </li>
<li> Reliability modeling of large-scale storage systems </li>
<li> Linux kernel internals </li>
</ul>
