      <h1>Academic Genealogy</h1>
      <p>My genealogy, like those of most academics, is plenty
      convoluted and contains lots of interesting characters. Instead
      of idly clicking through
      the <a href="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">Mathematics
      Genealogy Project</a> (MGP), I have decided that this endeavor
      deserves a bit more structure. I have a few overarching goals:
	<ol>
	  <li>Build a directed graph of advisors and advisees;</li>
	  <li>create a reasonable representation<a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a> of the graph; and</li>
	  <li>gather and organize in-depth information about those
	    within the graph.</li>
	</ol>
      </p>

	<li>History of Imperial College of London, 1907-2007, page
	  102: "John William Hinchley (1871-1931) was educated at
	  Lincoln Grammar School, leaving to become an apprentice
	  engineer at the Reliance Iron Works. He came to the Science
	  Schools on a National Scholarship in 1893, was an excellent
	  student and very active in union affairs. Later Hinchley
	  headed the Siamese Metallurgical Services (part of the new
	  Siamese Mint) in Bangkok. On returning to England he worked
	  as a consultant and part-time lecturer at the Battersea
	  Polytechnic before being appointed at Imperial. He was a
	  founder of the Institute of Chemical Engineering in
	  1922. Hinchley left his excellent library to the department
	  which was much enlarged after the Second World War by
	  donations from A. C. G. Egerton. It was named the
	  Egerton-Hinchley Library in 1960. See also, Edith Hinchley,
	  _John William Hinchley: chemical engineer_ (privately
	  printed by Lamley and Co., 1935). The author was Hinchley's
	  widow. She claims that Hinchley did very well at his grammar
	  school but that his family was very poor and could not
	  afford his matriculation examination fees. They saved for
	  the fee three times but when the money had to be surrendered
	  for a third time, Hinchley gave up any idea of going to
	  university and became an apprentice. He won the National
	  Scholarship while on a vacation course in London. (From
	  1866-91 the matriculation fee at the University of london
	  was [2 pounds]. While this is about [170 pounds] in today's
	  terms, the real difference between then and now is that late
	  Victorian society was very much poorer overall, and poor
	  families had almost no discretionary income.)"</li>
